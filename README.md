### Hi 👋, I am Ana Amaro, a SysAdmin and DevOps for 12 years who decided to reinvent herself and turn her technical profile into a FrontEnd Dev Jr. Currently, I am a mentor and help people with their personal brand on social networks. I contribute to the developer community by helping other colleagues and small communities to increase their potential and connect them through communication, respect and humility.
